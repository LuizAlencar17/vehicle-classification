## About

![Example](https://gtconsultoria.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-4.png)

Repository for classification of 7 types of vehicles using supervised learning with artificial neural networks. The types of vehicles that can be classified are:

'Ambulance': 0, 'Barge': 1, 'Bicycle': 2, 'Boat': 3, 'Bus': 4, 'Car': 5, 'Cart': 6

NOTE: The numbering of each vehicle type above corresponds to its numerical representation (necessary for the neural network).


## Dataset

The data (training images) can be accessed at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/vehicle/data

NOTE: For reasons of switching power, only a few car classes were adopted with a small amount of images for each car class.

## Installation

You need to install the following packages

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
pip install Pillow==2.2.2
pip install keras
```
